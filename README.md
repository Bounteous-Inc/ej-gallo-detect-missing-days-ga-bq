Scan for GA datasets in BQ for missing days of data (within a designated timeframe) and cross compare those dates with GA data to compile a list of properties that have traffic for those days but no corresponding BQ data for them.

The output of this will be used to open a ticket under Google Analytics 360 support to request a backfill of identified properties and days and can serve as a tool moving forward for ad-hoc scanning and data gap confirmation.
